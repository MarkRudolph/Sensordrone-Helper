Sensordrone-Helper
==================

An android helper library for the Sensordrone

This library contains useful methods for getting things up and running with your Sensordrone. The Sensordrone Control
app uses this library. You will need to export this jar file to add it to Sensordrone Control ( https://github.com/Sensorcon/Sensordrone-Control )

You will need to add the following library to compile: 

1) SDAndroidLib-1.1.1.jar available at http://developer.sensordrone.com/downloads/
2) android.jar (I built this against Android API 10: Gingerbread)
